# Why the Hype Around DeepSeek AI Might Be Overblown – A Talent Acquisition Perspective

The rise of DeepSeek AI, a new open-source competitor to ChatGPT, has sparked debates across industries. While its affordability and accessibility are impressive, it’s essential to keep things in perspective—especially in fields like HR and Talent Acquisition, where technology serves as an enabler, not a replacement for human connection.

Here’s the truth: AI tools like DeepSeek or ChatGPT are just that—tools. They can assist with repetitive tasks, like scanning resumes or automating initial outreach, but they can’t replace the nuanced judgment, empathy, and understanding that come from human interaction. Open-source models like DeepSeek come with risks too, from potential data breaches to algorithmic bugs, raising serious concerns about reliability and compliance. For organizations committed to excellence in Talent Acquisition, relying solely on such tools isn’t just risky—it’s a step backward.

At the heart of HR and Talent Acquisition is the ability to connect with people. Picking up the phone, speaking to candidates, understanding their stories, and gauging their motivations—these are the core aspects of what makes talent advisors invaluable. Organizations that continue to prioritize personal engagement will always have the edge. By combining human insight with AI-driven efficiency, they can balance speed with quality, ensuring the right candidates are not just identified but also understood.

For example, AI can help with the initial sorting of resumes, flagging key skills, or matching candidates to roles faster. But nothing replaces a thoughtful, personal conversation to assess a candidate’s fit for the organization, both culturally and professionally. A 30-minute Zoom or Teams call provides far more insight than any algorithm ever could. The way a candidate communicates, their tone, their passion, and even their body language—all these factors play a crucial role in making the right hiring decisions.

Companies that value these human touchpoints will ensure their Talent Advisors have the space and tools to do their jobs effectively. By leveraging AI for the mundane and reserving human interaction for the meaningful, these organizations will confidently build teams that align with their vision and values. And importantly, when those Talent Advisors pick up the phone or join a Zoom call, they can do so knowing they’ve done their job with integrity and care.

Ultimately, the best approach is a balanced one: embracing the benefits of AI to streamline processes while maintaining the human connection that defines exceptional Talent Acquisition. It’s not about choosing one over the other—it’s about blending the best of both worlds. AI may assist, but at the end of the day, it’s the human touch that builds lasting teams and drives organizational success.

**So, why worry? Let’s stay cautious and remember that innovation without accountability can lead to more harm than good.**
